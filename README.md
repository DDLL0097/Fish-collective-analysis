About analyzing three zebrafish's motion and their collective intermittent exploration behavior The codes is about estimating three fish's collective intermittent exploration behavior, it includes the codes about data processing, the estimator for the dynamic model's parameters, and the codes for generating Figure 5 (the potential function relationship about the Euclidean distasnce) in the paper. Please check the detailed theoretical part in the paper 'Collective intermittent exploration in fish schools is mediated by visual cues'.
